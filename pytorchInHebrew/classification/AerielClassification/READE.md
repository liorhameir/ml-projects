# aerial classification model, using pytorch.

classifies 17 classes from AID dataset including:
Bareland, beach, commercial, denseresident, famland, forest, industrial, mediumResidential, moutain, park, parking, playground, pond, port, river, sparse, residental, viaduct
accuracy of about 85% +-
With not to much effort this project can be generlize for many other classification tasks on differnent datasets
- main.py - maim runner
- runManager.py - taking care of one run at a time (multiple runs would be usefull in order to find there right hyperparameters)
